# handwritten-recognition
The goal of this app is to allow users to upload images they've taken of their own hand writting of mathematical symbols which is fed through a convolutional neural network. The user is then given a text representation of their work which they can then copy and paste or manipulate it in other programs (such as MatLab, wolframalpha, etc.)

Data taken from here: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~crohme2019/dataANDtools.html

Goals (Offline recognition):
1. Subtask b: Recognize basic math symbols (operations, variables, junk)
2. Subtask a: Recognize basic mathematical structure; bounding boxes
