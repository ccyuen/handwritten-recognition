# handwritten-recognition
app that recognizes simple hand-written mathematical symbols, equations and formulae
The goal of this app is to allow users to upload images they've taken of their own hand writting of mathematical symbols which is fed through a convolutional neural network. The user is then given a text representation of their work which they can then copy and paste or manipulate it in other programs (such as MatLab, wolframalpha, etc.)
